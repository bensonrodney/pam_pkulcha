# Star Wars sample file
the odds against navigating an asteroid field are... | never tell me the odds
I love you | I know
and I thought they smelt bad | on the outside
Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi | you're my only hope
Do or do not | There is no try
Fear is the path to | the dark side
I find your lack of faith | disturbing
made the Kessel run in less than | twelve parsecs
No. I am your | father
Now, young Skywalker, you will | die
